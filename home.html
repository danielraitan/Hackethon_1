<!-- Hello Daniel This is your Hackaton review. I will write here in general why i think and then point in your code
What feature i thin could be better in your project.
I liked your project. The idea of it is very nice and that you added more than one level of difficulty.
Maybe you could have done in the easy level the subsract as an option.
And in the medium or hard level also the posiblity to work with division or multiplication.
Good implementation of intervals and timers in your app. 
I also saw a very good implementation of DOM manipulation and the use of random elements.
About the styling of the page in general looks nice. I will only be aware of the aligment of my elements.
for example the next button once you had answer and the timer in the bottom need to be fixed. 
In general very good job Keep it like that.-->
